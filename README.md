# XJTU-VISON_SMARTCAR_2025
This is the open-source repository of the Xi'an Jiaotong University team for the Intelligent Vision track of the 2025 Smart Car Competition. It includes code for the chassis RT1064, MCX camera, and OpenART camera.
The team spent two months preparing for the competition. Although we ultimately achieved only the Second Prize in the Western Division, I believe our framework and methodology remain valuable.
